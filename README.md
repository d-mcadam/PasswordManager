# PasswordManager
Encrypts password managed file

# To-do
- Allow data to be saved to a file that can be loaded when the application launches again.
- Enable users to have the usernames and passwords typed automatically based on specified click location.
- - This will require the mouse clicks to be captured by the program so it can call the trigger to type the input. (Done in a previous project)
- Remember the last mouse coordinates that was selected by the user the last time they clicked to type the input.
- - Allow a trigger to be called to type the input but do not save the current mouse coordinates. (ctrl+click?)
- - Learn how to identify input fields programatically so the user does not have to specify input locations. (I'm not sure if this is possible for anything other than web browsers at this stage)
- Move mouse to specified coordinate locations and type input as user requested.
- Learn how to encrypt and descrypt files in Java.
- - Several websites bookmarked for later reference.
- Encrypt the password managed file so it is inaccessible to other applications and means of access.
- - Test, do NOT implement decryption and see if the application can access the file as normal.
- Decrypt the same file and present the data to the host application.
- - Test, make sure data is not being lost.
